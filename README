This project is allows for two-way communication between a browser
and an ARDUINO (www.arduino.cc) microcontroller.  Thanks to Scott
Schiller (www.schillmania.com) for developing arduino.js, which in
turn uses as3glue (code.google.com/p/as3glue) for the Flash
component, and also serproxy (see arduino.cc/playground/
Interfacing/SerialNet) for details.

So far this project includes a graphing front end using the flot 
(code.google.com/p/flot/) JavaScript library.

Directions for setup include:

- run the StandardFirmata on the Arduino
- plug in the Arduino via USB port
- start serproxy
- make sure Flash settings accept the directory where this code is
- open index.html

With all of these pieces in place, you can graph data from the 
Arduino in realtime.
