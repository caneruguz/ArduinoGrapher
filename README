This project is allows for two-way communication between a browser
and an ARDUINO (www.arduino.cc) microcontroller.  

After trying several methods of communicating with the Arduino this version uses an Ethernet shield and code prepared by Sam Fentress at Concord Consortium (https://github.com/sfentress/ArduinoEthernetCom). 

To get this working you will need 
- An Arduino (we used Uno in our tests)
- Arduino Ethernet Shield
- Ethernet cables
- Computer with Ethernet port


To get this working on your computer 
1. download and install the files into a folder. 
2. Download Sam's Arduino code that enables the communication (https://gist.github.com/2126328)
3. Open the Arduino IDE and upload the script in step 2 into the arduino
4. Plug in an ethernet cable into the Arduino ethernet shield. 
5. The code should work. You can test it out on working website of this project: http://code.caneruguz.com/arduinographer

The graphing is done by Flot (http://code.google.com/p/flot/).
